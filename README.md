# SupplyChain-With-Python
This project is a practical hands-on analysis of a supply chain dataset. It explores key metrics such as inventory and sales performance, shipping and logistics services and manufacturing and suppliers efficiency

## üìúOBJECTIVE / PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop an interactive python visualization that provides real-time insights into key supply chain metrics such as inventory levels, product performance, order fulfillment efficiency, and supplier reliability. The goal is  to make data-driven decisions that improve operational efficiency, reduce delays, optimize shipping costs, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. This visualization will serve as a centralized tool for tracking product availability, sales trends, shipping performance, and production quality, allowing stakeholders to proactively address bottlenecks and manage supply chain risks effectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏èTools Used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib.plt 
- Seaborn

## üìåKey Deliverables:
Data exploration and transformation
Revenue and stock level insights
Actionable recommendations for business optimization

### Insights
1. Sales Distribution:
   * Skincare products dominate sales at 45%, followed by haircare (30%) and cosmetics (25%). This indicates a high potential for skincare marketing strategies but also opportunities for haircare and cosmetics.
2.Shipping Performance
  *  Sea transportation has the slowest shipping time at an average of 7.1 days, while road transport is the fastest at 4.7 days. Shipping performance could be optimized by reducing reliance on slower modes.
3. Supplier Performance
  * Supplier 2 shows the highest manufacturing cost at $4,887, while Supplier 3 has the highest defect rate at 2.7%. Assessing supplier performance may lead to cost reductions and quality improvements.
4. Sales Performance by Product
 *  While skincare is performing well, there is potential to elevate haircare and cosmetics through targeted promotions or product enhancements.

### Recommendations
1. Focus on Underperforming Categories: Develop marketing initiatives aimed at haircare and cosmetics to increase their contribution to total sales.
2. Optimize Shipping Choices: Consider shifting a larger percentage of shipments to road transportation to leverage its faster delivery times and improve customer satisfaction.
3. Supplier Negotiations: Review contracts and negotiate pricing with suppliers, particularly Supplier 2, to lower production costs without sacrificing quality.
4. Investigate Defect Rates: Conduct quality control assessments on products from Supplier 3 to identify and mitigate defect issues, which may enhance overall product perception and reduce returns.

### Conclusions
- Implementing these objectives and recommendations can lead to a more efficient supply chain and an overall increase in profitability. - By focusing on maximizing skincare sales while promoting less popular categories, optimizing shipping routes, and enhancing supplier relationships.
-  The business can create a sustainable growth trajectory, reducing operational costs and improving customer satisfaction.
- Continuous monitoring of sales performance and supplier effectiveness will be essential to adapt to market shifts and maintain competitive advantage.
